# Maximum wait time is 600s = 10m:
Environment=MAXIMUM_WAIT_TIME=600

# Steady-state threshold = 2%
# Allowed values:
#  4  - absolute pod count (+/-)
#  4% - percent change (+/-)
#  -1 - disable the steady-state check
# Note: '%' must be escaped as '%%' in systemd unit files
Environment=STEADY_STATE_THRESHOLD=2%%

# Steady-state window = 120s
# If the running pod count stays within the given threshold for this time
# period, return CPU utilization to normal before the maximum wait time has
# expires
Environment=STEADY_STATE_WINDOW=120

# Steady-state minimum = 40
# Increasing this will skip any steady-state checks until the count rises above
# this number to avoid false positives if there are some periods where the
# count doesn't increase but we know we can't be at steady-state yet.
