                    They are directly applied to the cluster by default. This can be overriden

                          due to the Kubernetes limit for object names.
                          Note; Repeating the policyName across the sourceFile items will append

                          Note; Having empty policyName OR not assign it will make the generator
                                to create only the CR without adding the ACM policy template.

                            The remediationAction determines if the generated CR will be directly applied to the
                            cluster or not. This is an optional field that provides an override for the

                          against the cluster. This value takes precedence over complianceType
                          at the Spec level. If this value is omitted the value from the Spec
                          level is used.
