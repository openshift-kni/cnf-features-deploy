# ACM PolicyGenerator 
ACM Policy Generator Custom Resource (CRs) are the recommended alternative to Policy Generator Templates (PGT) CRs. Both CR types are used to generate ACM policies. ACM Policy Generator CRs are similar to PGT, but there are a few notable differences regarding its patching and placement strategies.

The [policy-generator-plugin](https://github.com/stolostron/policy-generator-plugin/policy-generator-plugin) examples in this directory are defining the DU profile policies using [ACM PolicyGenerator reference API](https://github.com/stolostron/policy-generator-plugin/policy-generator-plugin/blob/main/docs/policygenerator-reference.yaml). 

These examples will generate ACM policies same as the DU profile policies generated from [policygentemplates example](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/tree/master/ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/policygentemplates) AND specifically the policy content object-definition (source-crs) are identical.

# Comparison between PGT and ACM Policy Generator patching strategies

| PGT patch | ACMPG patch |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Uses Kustomize merge strategies [link](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/patchMultipleObjects.md)|PGT patches work by replacing variables with their values as defined by the patch|
|Relies only on patching, no embedded variable substitution|Overwrites values defined in patch|
|Does not support merging lists, only replace (missing support for OpenAPI schema)|Substitute variables defined in source CR with values defined in patch (for example $name)|
|Requires additional directives ($patch: replace) in patch to merge content that does not follow a schema (PTP plugins object)| Can overwrite the name and namespace defined in source CR reference|

# Using ACM Policy Generator templates


## Editing example templates from scratch
Using ACM Policy Generator templatess is similar to PGT as described in chapter 3 of the following readme describing the overall ZTP process [link](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/README.md)

3. Create the ACMPG Template CR for your site in your local clone of the git repository:
   1. Begin by choosing an appropriate example from out/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator. This directory demonstrates a 3-level policy framework which represents a well-supported low-latency profile tuned for the needs of 5G Telco DU deployments:
      - A single [acm-common-ranGen.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-common-ranGen.yaml) should be applied to SNO, and do not use [acm-common-mno-ranGen.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-common-mno-ranGen.yaml) file for SNO clusters.
      - For MNO clusters, it will require both [acm-common-ranGen.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-common-ranGen.yaml) and [acm-common-mno-ranGen.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/acm-common-mno-ranGen.yaml) file.
      - A set of shared `acm-group-du-*-ranGen.yaml`, each of which should be common across a set of similar clusters
      - An example [acm-example-sno-site.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/policygentemplates/acm-example-sno-site.yaml) which will normally be copied and updated for each individual site
   2. Ensure the labels defined in your PGTs `bindingRules` section correspond to the proper labels defined on the SiteConfig file(s) of the clusters you are managing.
   3. Ensure the content of the overlaid spec files matches your desired end state.  As a reference, the out/source-crs directory contains the full list of source-crs available to be included and overlayed by your PGT templates.
      - Note: Depending on the specific requirements of your clusters, you may need more than just a single group policy per cluster type, especially considering the example group policies each has a single PerformancePolicy which can only be shared across a set of clusters if those clusters consist of identical hardware configurations.
   4. Define all the policy namespaces in a yaml file much like in the example out/argocd/example/policygentemplates/ns.yaml
   5. Add all the ACM Policy Generator templates files and ns.yaml to the kustomization.yaml file, much like in the example [kustomization.yaml](ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/example/acmpolicygenerator/kustomization.yaml)
   6. Commit the PolicyGenTemplate CRs, ns.yaml, and associated kustomization.yaml in git.
4. Push your changes to the git repository, and the ArgoCD pipeline will detect the changes and begin the site deployment. The SiteConfig and PolicyGenTemplate CRs can be pushed simultaneously. Note: The policyGenTemplate CRs and associated ns.yaml, kustomization.yaml must be pushed to the git repository within the 20 mins after the SiteConfigs are pushed.

## Adding ManagedClustersetbinding 
A ManagedClusterSet object brings together managed clusters with same access rights. In ZTP, the default clusterset is named `global`.
With ACM Policy Generator templatess, it is required to specify a clusterset binding. The ManagedClusterSetBinding adds a namespace to to the list of namespaces allowed to managed the managed clusters in the clusterset.
The ManagedClusterSetBinding can be added to the ns.yaml file. The managed ManagedClusterSetBinding below adds the `ztp-common`, `ztp-group` and `ztp-site` namespaces to the list of namespaces part of the `global` Clusterset

```
---
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  name: global
  namespace: ztp-common
spec:
  clusterSet: global
---
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  name: global
  namespace: ztp-group
spec:
  clusterSet: global
---
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
metadata:
  name: global
  namespace: ztp-site
spec:
  clusterSet: global
```

# Patching CR objects containing lists
Creating patches for CR objects containing lists is not currently supported by ACM the Generator Plugin. As a workwaround, the full content of final object must be contained in the patch. 
The pgt2acmpg tool supports creating such a patch that contains the full content of the CR, see below.

# Converting ACM Policy Generator templatess from exising Policy Gen Templates 
The pgt2acmpg supports converting Policy Gen Templates to ACM Policy Generator templatess◊. More details can be found at [link](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/ztp/tools/pgt2acmpg/blob/main/README.md)

##### Setup ArgoCD Application

The DU profile ACM PolicyGenerator examples can be used with the same [policies-app](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml) that is used to deploy the DU profile policygentemplates examples. For more info how to setup the ArgoCD policies application follow the [ReadMe](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/ztp/gitops-subscriptions/argocd/README.md) section "Preparation of Hub cluster for ZTP". The Git repo that will be used with the ArgoCD policies application should contain the source-crs directory and must co-exist with the DU profile ACM PolicyGenerator as shown below as example
