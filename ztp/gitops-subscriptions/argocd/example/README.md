The directories in here contain examples for:
* SiteConfig
* the ACM PolicyGenerator
* the ZTP PolicyGenTemplate

The ```policygentemplates``` and ```acmpolicygenerator``` contain untemplated examples for all cluster configuration.
Under each of the two directories there is also a ```hub-side-templating``` directory which contains examples for how to use hub templates for declaring the policies.
