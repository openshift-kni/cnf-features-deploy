# Purpose: This script ensures that specific files containing hardcoded release versions are up to date with the current release and do not reference any previous versions.

# Functionality:
# 1. Determines if the current branch is a release branch (e.g., release-4.x).
# 2. Extracts the previous version (e.g. 4.16 for release-4.17).
# 3. Checks specific files for any occurrences of the previous version.
# 4. If matches are found, it prompts the user to update references to the current release branch and exits with an error code.
# 5. Skips checks for non-release branches or missing files.
